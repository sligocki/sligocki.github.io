title: BBB(5, 2) Search Results
tag: busy-beaver
---

Searching for [Beeping Busy Beavers]({% post_url 2021-03-06-beeping-busy-beaver %}) is a harrowing task, since even detecting that a TM has beeped for the last time (quasihalted) is in general uncomputable. However, as Nick Drozd [has shown](https://nickdrozd.github.io/2022/02/11/latest-beeping-busy-beaver-results.html) over the last year or so, there is still progress to be made just looking at the types of quasihalting we can definitively prove. Over the last couple weeks, I've retooled [the codebase](https://github.com/sligocki/busy-beaver) (that my Dad and I have developed over the last 15 years) to be able to detect quasihalting behavior and then enumerated various domains.

This search has been very fruitful in the 5-state, 2-symbol search I would like to announce several new machines of interest:

## A new BBB(5, 2) champion:

|  B  | 1RC | 0RD |

|  E  | 1LE | 1LA |

`1RB 1LC  1RC 0RD  0LB 0RC  0RE 1RD  1LE 1LA`

which I calculate as quasihalting on step:

After which point it is in state E on a blank tape and will now move to the left writing 1s forever (because `E0 -> 1LE`). It was last in state D one step earlier.

Nick, you might be curious to know that this machine is also a [Blanking Beaver](https://nickdrozd.github.io/2021/02/14/blanking-beavers.html). In fact, it actually reaches a blank tape in every one of it's 5 states! All 4 non-trivial one are near the end:

actually, when I first found these two machines, I mistakenly thought that this was the champion (partially because GNU `sort` silently fails to correctly numerically sort integers of this size!) I have underlined the section of digits in which these two numbers first differ (about halfway through the digit string).

I am working on an analysis of these two machines that I will share soon, but it appears that they are both simulating the exact same [Collatz-like]({% post_url 2021-07-17-bb-collatz %}) function. The champion just does it slightly more inefficiently ... and thus wins the race because in the Beeping Busy Beaver game we are actually looking for the slowest machine to cross the finish line :)

## A machine with (slightly) more complex quasihalting behavior

Almost all of the top machines I found (19 of the top 20, for example) quasihalt in an extremely easy to detect way. They enter into what I am calling "Chain Recurrence" (Nick calls this 1-step [Lin Recurrence](https://nickdrozd.github.io/2021/02/24/lin-recurrence-and-lins-algorithm.html)). It is the behavior I described above for the 10<sup>502</sup> champions I listed above. Specifically: we are in configuration <code>S> 0<sup>∞</sup></code> and `S0 -> ?RS` (or the mirror image: <code>0<sup>∞</sup> <S</code> and `S0 -> ?LS`) and so we can easily see that the TM will remain in state S forever after, just moving right (or left) over and endless stream of 0s.

Here is the 1 top 20 machine I found so far which does something slightly more complex:

|     |  0  |  1  |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
|  A  | 1RB | 1RD |
|  B  | 1LC | 1LB |
|  C  | 1LD | 1RA |
|  D  | 0RE | 0RD |
|  E  | 1LB | 1RE |

`1RB 1RD  1LC 1LB  1LD 1RA  0RE 0RD  1LB 1RE`

It quasihalts at step 94418964659944351442398224758 (>9.4 × 10<sup>28</sup>), blanks the tape at step 12250514892052349453616935044134 (>1.2 × 10<sup>31</sup>) and then enters into what Brady called "Christmas Tree" Recurrence. Explicitly:

for any `n ≥ 0`:

<samp>
  0<sup>∞</sup> <D 1<sup>n</sup> 0<sup>∞</sup><br/>
  0<sup>∞</sup> E> 1<sup>n</sup> 0<sup>∞</sup><br/>
  0<sup>∞</sup> 1<sup>n</sup> E> 0<sup>∞</sup><br/>
  0<sup>∞</sup> 1<sup>n</sup> <B 1 0<sup>∞</sup><br/>
  0<sup>∞</sup> <B 1<sup>n+1</sup> 0<sup>∞</sup><br/>
  0<sup>∞</sup> <C 1<sup>n+2</sup> 0<sup>∞</sup><br/>
  0<sup>∞</sup> <D 1<sup>n+3</sup> 0<sup>∞</sup><br/>
</samp>

and then this process repeats forever, increasing the number of `1`s by 3 each recurrence. Note that this recurrence never enters state `A`, which is how we detect that this machine actually quasihalted much earlier.

## Enumeration Status

I thought that some of you might be interested in the overall size of the BBB landscape. I've enumerated TMs in the following domains:

| Domain | max # loops |       # TMs | # Quasihalt | % Quasihalt |  # Unknown | % Unknown |
|:------:|:-----------:|------------:|------------:|------------:|-----------:|----------:|
|   2x2  | 1M          |         121 |          17 |       14.0% |          1 |      0.8% |
|   2x3  | 1M          |      10,393 |         974 |        9.4% |        192 |      1.8% |
|   3x2  | 1M          |      16,549 |       4,249 |       25.7% |        112 |      0.7% |
|   2x4  | 1M          |   1,869,525 |     133,612 |        7.1% |     69,331 |      3.7% |
|   4x2  | 1M          |   2,943,669 |     919,061 |       31.2% |     26,136 |      0.9% |
|   3x3  | 1k          | 164,537,029 |  26,451,658 |       16.1% |  5,086,812 |      3.1% |
|   2x5  | 1k          | 548,090,457 |  32,489,678 |        5.9% | 44,087,899 |      8.0% |
|   5x2  | 50k         | 687,161,765 | 248,328,604 |       36.1% | 10,822,343 |      1.6% |

* Domain: NxM means N-state, M-symbol
* \# TMs: the number of TMs enumerated using Tree Normal Form (Nick calls this Brady's algorithm) where the first transition is always forced to be `A0 -> 1RB` and we allow machines with no halt transitions.
* max \# loops: Number of "simulator loops" I have run all of the TMs in this domain for. Note that this is an accelerated simulator, so one sim loop can translate into a large number of TM steps. \# loops is roughly proportional to simulation time.
* \# Quasihalt: does not include \# Halt
* \# Unknown: The number of "holdout" machines which our system has not been able to make any conclusion about, if you can get this to 0, you've "proven" the BBB for that domain.

Everything up to 4x2 case can be run serially locally (it took me 7hr to run 4x2 out to 10k loops on my laptop). For the 3 biggest domains (3x3, 2x5, 5x2) I have been running in parallel on a cluster of 20 12-core machines. Running 5x2 out to 50k took about 4300 core-hours (~18 hours on the cluster). I ran 5x2 up to 1k, 2k, 10k, 25k, and 50k and up until 25k each increase led to a new BBB(5, 2) champion. 50k run did not find anything new so I decided it was a good time to share the news :)

All the code to enumerate and simulate these domains is available at our [Busy Beaver repo](https://github.com/sligocki/busy-beaver). And some results are also available there. For example, my top 20 BBB(5, 2) champions are at: <https://github.com/sligocki/busy-beaver/blob/main/Machines/5x2-Beep-Top>. The code is perhaps not the most user-friendly / documented at the moment, but I'm currently working on improving that. [Send me an email](mailto:sligocki@gmail.com) if your interested in playing around with this or using it to analyze long running Beavers.

## Reflection

Even with the simplest of quasihalting conditions (Chain Recurrence), we've been able to push BBB(5,&nbsp;2) > 10<sup>502</sup>. Is there more out there? I imagine yes. While almost all of the TMs we proved quasihalting were proven using Chain/Lin Recurrence, there is a clear selection bias here. We only found what our system was programmed to find. Among the > 10M remaining Unknown TMs, I predict that there will be some monsters which exhibit far more complex quasihalting behavior ... but how do we find them? I excited look forward to new techniques being developed and deployed!
