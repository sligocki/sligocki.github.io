My name is Shawn Ligocki. I'm a Software Engineer, currently working for the [Cornell Lab of Ornithology](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/) where I help produce [maps of bird abundance](https://ebird.org/science/status-and-trends/) based on the community science eBird project. I'm also a recreational Mathematician. My father, Terry, and I discovered the [current reigning 2-state 4-symbol Busy Beaver champion](http://www.logique.jussieu.fr/~michel/ha.html#tm24) and [the 6-state 2-symbol Busy Beaver champion from 2007-2010](http://www.logique.jussieu.fr/~michel/ha.html#tm62).
