May has been quite a month for the Busy Beaver competition! After 12 years of no progress on the $$BB(6, 2)$$ domain, [my discovery]({% post_url 2022-05-13-bb-6-2-e78913 %}) has kicked off quite the flurry of activity:

A few notes:

 1. *Name* is simply a shorthand name I will use to refer to these machines in this article. As you can probably infer, they are just a shorthand for the $$BB(6, 2)$$ bound listed.
 2. I am using [Knuth's up-arrow notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_up-arrow_notation) for the last two records. So, for example, $$10↑↑5 = 10^{10^{10^{10^{10}}}}$$

I must (slightly begrudgingly) tip my hat to Pavel, who has, so far, refused to allow me to hold the champion title for over 3 days! But I take pride in knowing that my `t5` machine brought us past a notable threshold: These numbers can no longer be stored directly in binary in computer memory. In fact, I cannot even tell you how many digits these numbers have or even the number of digits that [the number of digits] has without using a special notation.

In order to simulate these machines, we need symbolic notations for representing numbers and this turns out to make many problems (that were easy with binary representation) significantly more challenging! Let me show you via an analysis of Pavel's current champion, `t15`.


## Analysis of Pavel's t15

### The Machine

This is Pavel's current champion (`t15`):

|     |  0  |  1  |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
|  A  | 1RB | 0LD |
|  B  | 1RC | 0RF |
|  C  | 1LC | 1LA |
|  D  | 0LE | 1RZ |
|  E  | 1LF | 0RB |
|  F  | 0RC | 0RE |

Pavel [announced](https://groups.google.com/g/busy-beaver-discuss/c/-zjeW6y8ER4/m/ZBuLvbVOAgAJ) this machine on 30 May 2022 and listed the halting configuration as `1 H> 0
1^((81*(3^((27*(3^((27*(3^((27*(3^((27*(3^((27*(3^((27*(3^((27*(3^((27*(3^((27*(3^((27*(3^((27*(3^((27*(3^((27*(3^((27*(3^((27*(3^(1)) - 17)/8)) - 3)/8)) - 17)/8)) - 1)/8)) - 17)/8)) - 3)/8)) - 17)/8)) - 1)/8)) - 17)/8)) - 1)/8)) - 17)/8)) - 3)/8)) - 17)/8)) - 1)/8)) - 19)/8)) - 13)/2)`. I provided a [preliminary analysis](https://groups.google.com/g/busy-beaver-discuss/c/-zjeW6y8ER4/m/nikhevxsAgAJ) on 31 May and Pascal Michel [corrected a mistake in my analysis](https://groups.google.com/g/busy-beaver-discuss/c/-zjeW6y8ER4/m/nikhevxsAgAJ) and provided some numeric improvements the algorithm. In this post I will synthesize this discussion into a complete analysis.


### The Collatz Rules

Let <code>C(n) = 0<sup>∞</sup> 1 0<sup>n</sup> 11 0<sup>5</sup> C> 0<sup>∞</sup></code>

The following rules can be proven:

 * Rule R0: $$C(4k) \to Halt((3^{k+3} - 11) / 2)$$
 * Rule R1: $$C(4k+1) \to C((3^{k+3} - 11) / 2)$$
 * Rule R2: $$C(4k+2) \to C((3^{k+3} - 11) / 2)$$
 * Rule R3: $$C(4k+3) \to C((3^{k+3} +  1) / 2)$$

I leave the proof as an exercise to the reader. The process of proving these is similar to that in my previous analyses of the [BBB(3, 3) champion]({% post_url 2022-02-27-bb-recurrence-relations %}) and [e78k]({% post_url 2022-05-13-bb-6-2-e78913 %}). As a hint: start by trying to prove that $$B(n+4, m) \to B(n, 3m+7)$$ (where <code>B(n, m) = 0<sup>∞</sup> 1 0<sup>n</sup> 11 0<sup>3m+2</sup> C> 0<sup>∞</sup></code>).


### Naive evaluation

Starting from a blank tape:

 * At step 45, the TM is in configuration $$C(5) = C(4 \cdot 1 + 1)$$
 * Applying R1: $$C(4 \cdot 1 + 1) \to C((3^{1+3} - 11) / 2) = C(35) = C(4 \cdot 8 + 3)$$
 * Applying R3: $$C(4 \cdot 8 + 3) \to C((3^{3+3} + 1) / 2) = C(88574) = C(4 \cdot 22143 + 2)$$
 * Applying R2: $$C(4 \cdot 22143 + 2) \to C((3^{22143+3} - 11) / 2) = C(A_3) = C(4 k_3 + 3)$$
 * Applying R3: $$C(4 k_3 + 2) \to C((3^{k_3+3} + 1) / 2) = C(A_4) = C(4 k_4 + r_4)$$

$$A_3 ≈ 1.1 \times 10^{10566}$$ is too large of a number to write out here fully, but modern computers can calculate it and easily store it in memory directly in binary. However, $$A_4 > 10^{10^{10564}}$$ is far too big to store directly in binary notation in any computer that will ever exist (it would require more bits than there are [atoms in the observable universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddington_number)!). So this is the end of the road when it comes to direct computation. We'll need some new math in order to determine $$r_4$$ (and future $$r_k$$).


### Exponentiation and Modular Arithmetic

So, how can we efficiently compute the remainder $$r$$ of $$(3^{k+3} - 11) / 2$$ modulo 4? Well doing a little arithmetic, we get:

 * $$(3^{k+3} + 1) / 2 = 4 k + r$$
 * $$3^{k+3} + 1 = 8 k + 2r$$
 * $$3^{k+3} = 8k + 2r - 1$$

So this problem reduces to the problem of efficiently computing $$3^{n} \pmod{8}$$. Let's look at some small examples:

| $$n$$ | $$3^{n}$$ | $$3^{n} \pmod{8}$$ |
| --: | --: | --: |
|   0 |   1 |   1 |
|   1 |   3 |   3 |
|   2 |   9 |   1 |
|   3 |  27 |   3 |
|   4 |  81 |   1 |
|   5 | 243 |   3 |
|   6 | 729 |   1 |

So, there seems to be a pattern here that $$3^{2k} \equiv 1 \pmod{8}$$ and $$3^{2k+1} \equiv 3 \pmod{8}$$ and (in fact) that's pretty easy to show since:

$$3^{2k+r} = 3^{2k} 3^{r} = 9^k 3^r \equiv 1^k 3^r = 3^r \pmod{8}$$

### Continuing evaluation

So, going back to our analysis. In order to compute $$r_4$$ we need to calculate $$k_3 + 3 \pmod{2}$$. And we know the binary expansion of $$k_3$$, so this calculate this directly, specifically $$k_3$$ is odd, so $$k_3 + 3$$ is even and thus

 * $$2 r_4 - 1 \equiv 3^{k_3+3} \equiv 1 \pmod{8}$$
 * $$2 r_4 \equiv 2 \pmod{8}$$
 * $$r_4 = 1$$

So,

 * $$A_4 = 4 k_4 + 1$$
 * Applying R1: $$C(4 k_4 + 1) \to C((3^{k_4+3} - 11) / 2) = C(A_5) = C(4 k_5 + r_5)$$

Hm, so we already know that in order to find $$r_5$$ we need to know $$k_4 + 3 \pmod{2}$$. Let $$k_4 = 2k + r$$ then $$A_4 = 8k + 2r - 1$$. So now we need to find out what is $$A_4 \pmod{8}$$ (Note: We previously calculated $$A_4 \pmod{4}$$).


### Generalizing Exponentiation and Modular Arithmetic

In [a previous section](#exponentiation-and-modular-arithmetic) we figured out how to evaluate $$3^n \pmod{8}$$, but now we want to calculate $$3^n \pmod{16}$$. Can we (perhaps) generalize this to calculating arbitrary $$3^n \pmod{2^m}$$? For the $$3^n \pmod{8}$$ we solved this problem by discovering that $$3^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{8}$$. So, in order to solve our general problem of computing $$3^n \pmod{2^m}$$ we need to find a value `k` such that $$3^k \equiv 1 \pmod{2^m}$$. In fact, this is a well-studied question from Group Theory. Specifically,  $$(\mathbb{Z}/2^m\mathbb{Z})^\times$$ (the [multiplicative group of integers modulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_group_of_integers_modulo_n) $$2^m$$).
