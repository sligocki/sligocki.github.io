Why should we care about the [WikiTree Network]({% post_url 2021-06-24-wikitree-network-definition %})? To some extent, I would like to understand it's structure more fully simply because it is a place I spend a lot of time. Each week I get an email telling me my degrees of separation from various people and I'd like to understand those numbers in context. But, at the end of the day, what I really want to know is: How do I fit into the web of humanity? And I use WikiTree as a tool to try and understand this theoretical goal.

## The Human Kinship Network

I will call this complete web of humanity, the "Human Kinship Network". Now, we can go ahead and define a new version of each of the networks we [defined for the WikiTree Network]({% post_url 2021-06-24-wikitree-network-definition %}). We could create a Complete Person Network, a Complete Bipartite Network and a Complete Family Network
